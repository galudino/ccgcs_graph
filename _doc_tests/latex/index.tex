 \doxysubsection*{A graph A\+DT, written in C++}

The goal of this repository is to further my understanding of graphs,~\newline
 and to practice C++ in general (in particular, using templates and smart pointers)

I want to have the following abstractions\+:~\newline
~\newline
 {\ttfamily position}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item stores euclidean coordinates x, y, z
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily edge$<$edge\+\_\+type$>$}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item stores a weight/cost (a floating point value)
\item stores an {\ttfamily edge\+\_\+type}, a type parameter defined by the user
\item stores a {\ttfamily parent\+\_\+id} (ID of node u) and {\ttfamily child\+\_\+id} (ID of node v)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily node$<$node\+\_\+type, edge\+\_\+type$>$}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item stores a {\ttfamily position}
\item stores a {\ttfamily node\+\_\+type}, a type parameter defined by the user
\item stores a container of {\ttfamily edge$<$edge\+\_\+type$>$}
\item stores an id
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily graph$<$node\+\_\+type, edge\+\_\+type$>$}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item will store nodes as a dictionary of {\ttfamily \mbox{[}id \+: node\mbox{]}}
\item subject to change, as I learn more
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{What I want the most for this graph\+: parameterized types}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily edge} and {\ttfamily node} can store their own data types
\item {\ttfamily graph}, by extension, has an {\ttfamily edge\+\_\+type} and {\ttfamily node\+\_\+type}
\item Depth-\/first search
\item Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s Shortest Path Algorithm
\end{DoxyItemize}

I do not plan to use any outside libraries --~\newline
 I will only use the C++ Standard Library and the C++ Standard Template Library.

\doxysubsection*{How to use}

At this time, this guide/source code is being written/tested on mac\+OS 10.\+15.\+5.~\newline


I cannot guarantee compatibility with other platforms,~\newline
 but since I am only using the C++ Standard Library and the C++ S\+TL,~\newline
 I do not anticipate any issues with other platforms, like Windows or the various flavors of Linux.~\newline


Clone the {\bfseries{gcs\+\_\+graph}} repository onto your machine.~\newline
 Navigate to the local copy of {\bfseries{gcs\+\_\+graph}} on your system,~\newline
 then type {\ttfamily make}. (a {\bfseries{Makefile}} is provided with the repository)

You have now built the sources for {\bfseries{gcs\+\_\+graph}}.~\newline


Type {\ttfamily ./main} to run the code in {\ttfamily client/main.\+cpp},~\newline
 or type {\ttfamily ./test} to run the code in {\ttfamily tests/test.\+cpp}.

\doxysubsection*{Creating a .tar.\+gz archive (tarball)}

You can make an archive (tarball) of your local copy of this repository~\newline
 by typing {\ttfamily ./maketarball your\+\_\+chosen\+\_\+name.\+tar.\+gz},~\newline
 where \textquotesingle{}your\+\_\+chosen\+\_\+name\textquotesingle{} is...a name of your choice.~\newline


Don\textquotesingle{}t forget the {\ttfamily .tar.\+gz} extension.

Example\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily ./maketarball gcs\+\_\+graph.\+tar.\+gz}
